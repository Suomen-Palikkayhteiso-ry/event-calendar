# Mobile Responsiveness

## User Story

As a user, I want to access the calendar and event details on my mobile device so that I can check events on the go.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The application layout adapts to small screens (mobile phones) and tablets.
- Navigation menu collapses into a hamburger menu or similar mobile-friendly pattern on small screens.
- Calendar view switches to a list-based or condensed view if the monthly grid is too wide for mobile.
- Forms (Create/Edit Event) are usable on touch screens.
- Map view handles touch gestures (pinch-to-zoom, swipe-to-pan) correctly.
- Text sizes are legible on small screens without zooming.

## Scenarios

- User opens app on iPhone/Android -> sees mobile-optimized layout.
- User rotates device -> layout adjusts.
- User taps "Menu" -> navigation links appear.
