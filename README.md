# Event Calendar

Event calendar for Suomen Palikkaharrastajat ry, built with Elm 0.19, Haskell, and PocketBase.


## Overview

The project combines:

- an Elm frontend in [`elm-app/`](/workspaces/web/event-calendar/elm-app) for the public calendar, event views, and authenticated editing
- a Haskell static generator in [`statics/`](/workspaces/web/event-calendar/statics) for feeds, printable pages, and exported assets

Features include calendar and list views, event detail pages, authenticated CRUD, KML import, Leaflet maps, and static exports such as iCal, RSS, Atom, JSON Feed, and GeoJSON.

## Development Environment

This project uses `devenv` for local development and CI.

```sh
make develop
make shell
```

On a fresh environment, run `cabal update` before the first `cabal build statics`.

The default PocketBase URL is `https://data.palikkaharrastajat.fi`. For local development, set `VITE_POCKETBASE_URL` and `POCKETBASE_URL` via `.env` or use the `*-local` Makefile targets. Local PocketBase and Keycloak services are available through `devenv up`.

## Common Commands

## Shared Frontend Conventions

The frontend follows the Suomen Palikkaharrastajat design guide:

- https://logo.palikkaharrastajat.fi/
- https://logo.palikkaharrastajat.fi/brand.css

Shared Elm design tokens and UI components are exposed through [`elm-app/packages`](/workspaces/web/event-calendar/elm-app/packages), which points to [`vendor/master-builder/packages`](/workspaces/web/event-calendar/vendor/master-builder/packages).

Frontend tooling is managed through Nix, not `pnpm`:

- [`pkgs/package.json`](/workspaces/web/event-calendar/pkgs/package.json)
- [`pkgs/package-lock.json`](/workspaces/web/event-calendar/pkgs/package-lock.json)
- [`pkgs/npm-tools.nix`](/workspaces/web/event-calendar/pkgs/npm-tools.nix)

## CI and Deployment

GitHub Actions builds and deploys the site to GitHub Pages.

- [`deploy.yml`](/workspaces/web/event-calendar/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
- [`scheduled.yml`](/workspaces/web/event-calendar/.github/workflows/scheduled.yml)

Human-facing usage lives here in `README.md`. Agent-specific development instructions live in [`AGENTS.md`](/workspaces/web/event-calendar/AGENTS.md).
