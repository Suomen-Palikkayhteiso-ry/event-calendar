/**
 * Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration
 *
 * Note: In Tailwind v4, theme configuration (colors, spacing, etc.) is done
 * via CSS using @theme blocks in your CSS files (see src/app.css).
 * This config file is only used for:
 * - content paths (where to scan for classes)
 * - plugins
 *
 * Color configuration has been moved to src/app.css @theme block.
